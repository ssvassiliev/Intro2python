    "### Change One Thing at a Time, For a Reason\n",
    "When debugging, it's crucial to change one thing at a time for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation of Issues**: Modifying a single aspect allows you to clearly see its effect, making it easier to identify what fixes the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoiding New Bugs**: Changing multiple parts of the code simultaneously increases the risk of introducing new issues, complicating the debugging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified Testing**: After each change, you can run tests to verify the fix, ensuring that your code functions as intended before moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Building Understanding**: This approach deepens your understanding of how different parts of your code interact, helping you learn from mistakes and successes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documentation and Communication**: It makes it easier to communicate changes with team members, providing clear documentation of your debugging process.\n",

    "- **Reproducibility**: It allows you to repeat tests and revisit changes, ensuring a clear understanding of what worked and what didn’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Tracking your efforts prevents wasting time on the same issues by reminding you of past tests and their outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clarity**: Detailed notes help clarify your thought process and identify patterns, reducing confusion when solving complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Clear records facilitate communication when seeking help from others, making it easier for them to understand the problem and provide useful guidance.\n",
